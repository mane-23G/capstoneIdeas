# Capstone Ideas

## 1. Rubik's Cube Solver

My first idea would be a Rubik's Cube Solver, it would most likely be a website that would require the user to input the cube details and then shows the steps to solve it. This would most likelt be done using javascript, html, css and if possible to use c++ for the backend algorithm to solve the rubix cube

## 2. Random Show/ Movie Selector

Random Show and Movie selectors do exist but this one would just be better. It would allow for selection of the various streaming services and a selection of genres. It would combine the features of JustWatch and IMBD. It would also give an option to create an account and possibly sugest shows/movies based on the users previous ratings. It would again most likely use javascript,html, and css and other languages if requried.

## 3. Quizlet Upgraded 

This would be an advanced Quizlet taking powerpoints/pdfs/notes from the user and generates questions for the user. It would use python, NLTK, PyTorch, or GPT. I dont know how to use the stuff for AI but I'll learn I guess.
